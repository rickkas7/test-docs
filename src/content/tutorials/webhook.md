Webhooks provide a way for Particle devices to communicate with an external server. This interactive tutorial demonstrates publishing events from a Particle device, using a webhook, and optionally handing responses and errors.

### Webhook configuration

This is the configuration for the webhook that was created in your account. The meaning of all of the fields will be explained in the [Webhook details](#webhook-details) section, below.

{{> webhook-tutorial-hook}}

- The **Test webhook** button will be used in the [Simple test](/#simple-test) section below.
- To view the newly created webhook in the Particle console, you can use the **Open in Console** button, above.

### Log

The log shows things of interest regarding events, webhooks, and the server. 

{{> webhook-tutorial-log}}

### Simple test

You can do a simple test to see all of these events by using the **Test webhook** button above.

Note that the Log scrolls horizontally and will auto-scroll to the right if you are already at the right edge.

The first item is **Event (API)**. This is an event generated by the Particle API from clicking the **Test webhook button**. The data payload in this example contains JSON data, which we recommend, but is not required. Note that since the event name begins with the webhook name, the webhook is triggered. Webhooks use a prefix match, so a single webhook can handle multiple events, if desired.

The webhook is named {{webhook-tutorial "webhookName"}}. If the event name begins with this string, the webhook will be triggered. Note that the event name in the webhook is a prefix, so it will match any event name that begins with that string. It is case-sensitive, however.

{{> webhook-tutorial-example options="api,event,trigger"}}

The second item is the **Event (Internal)** of the hook-sent event. This is generated when a webhook is triggered because its event name matches the name of an event generated by the API or a device.

{{> webhook-tutorial-example options="api,event,hook-sent"}}

The third item is the **Webhook received** (orange) which is the data that was received by the server that was specified in the Webhook URL field. In this case, it's a POST request, and the HTTP headers and body are displayed. These will be described in more detail below, but the body comes from the JSON configured in the Webhook, and the data within the body comes from the published event. Note that individual fields like headers and body also scroll horizontally.

{{> webhook-tutorial-example options="api,hook"}}

The fourth item is **Parsed data** (pink) which is a JSON decoded version of the published event data. The time at the top is your local time, as determine by your browser, not the actual event time.

{{> webhook-tutorial-example options="api,data"}}

The fifth item is **Webhook response** is the data that the webhook server is returning to the Particle webhook system. The body is also JSON in this case, and includes whether this is successful ("ok":true) as well as the "id" that was in the original request. 

{{> webhook-tutorial-example options="api,hookResponse"}}

The sixth item is the **Event (Internal)** containing the hook-response. This is the event that is sent by the Particle webhook service. The name begins with "api" because it would normally begin with the Device ID that published the triggering event, but since the test button was used, there is no Device ID. It's just "api".

{{> webhook-tutorial-example options="api,event,hook-response"}}

### Device firmware

The next step is to run the firmware below on a device. The code will be explained line-by-line below, but for now you don't need to understand everything about it, except:

- It will publish an event every minute that will trigger the webhook.
- If you tap the MODE button once, it will also generate an event.
- Because of this, if you leave this firmware running it will use at least two data operations per minute, one for the request and one for the response.
- You can flash the device right from the box below, but note that it will replace the existing device firmware and you won't be able to restore the original firmware automatically.

{{> codebox content="/assets/files/webhook-tutorial.cpp" format="cpp" height="400" flash="true"}}

The firmware output information from the debugging serial port, so you may want to connect the device by USB to your computer and use the Particle CLI command:

```
particle serial monitor
```

This will show both the published events and the response:

```
0006480001 [app] INFO: publish WebhookTutorial01 {"op":"periodic","id":1652008511,"powerSource":2,"soc":-1}
0006480913 [app] INFO: hook response {"ok":true,"id":1652008511}
```

The log output will be similar to the test but first item will be **Event (Device)**. Note that the **coreid** contains the Device ID that generated the device. This is secure; there is no way to generate an arbitrary ID or spoof an ID in this field. 

{{> webhook-tutorial-example options="device,event,trigger"}}

The **Webhook received** event is similar but note the **coreid** in the body. You will often use this to determine which device sent the webhook. Note that other things, like the device name (which is not necessarily unique), and other identifying things like the serial number, ICCID, etc. are not passed to the webhook so you should use the Device ID (coreid) as the unique identifier for a device.

{{> webhook-tutorial-example options="device,hook"}}

The **Parsed data** contains additional information for cellular devices to show how to easily add data to the JSON data. It will contain the **powerSource** and battery **soc** (state-of-charge).

{{> webhook-tutorial-example options="device,data"}}

The last **Event (Internal)** is the hook-response that is generated.

{{> webhook-tutorial-example options="device,event,hook-response"}}
