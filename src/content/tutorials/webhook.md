Webhooks provide a way for Particle devices to communicate with an external server. This interactive tutorial demonstrates publishing events from a Particle device, using a webhook, and optionally handing responses and errors.

### Webhook configuration

This is the configuration for the webhook that was created in your account. The meaning of all of the fields will be explained in the [Webhook details](#webhook-details) section, below.

{{> webhook-tutorial-hook}}

- The **Test webhook** button will be used in the [Simple test](/#simple-test) section below.
- To view the newly created webhook in the Particle console, you can use the **Open in Console** button, above.

### Log

The log shows things of interest regarding events, webhooks, and the server. 

{{> webhook-tutorial-log}}

### Simple test

You can do a simple test to see all of these events by using the **Test webhook** button above.

Note that the Log scrolls horizontally and will auto-scroll to the right if you are already at the right edge.

The first item is **Event (API)**. This is an event generated by the Particle API from clicking the **Test webhook button**. The data payload in this example contains JSON data, which we recommend, but is not required. Note that since the event name begins with the webhook name, the webhook is triggered. Webhooks use a prefix match, so a single webhook can handle multiple events, if desired.

The webhook is named {{webhook-tutorial "webhookName"}}. If the event name begins with this string, the webhook will be triggered. Note that the event name in the webhook is a prefix, so it will match any event name that begins with that string. It is case-sensitive, however.

{{> webhook-tutorial-example options="api,event,trigger"}}

The second item is the **Event (Internal)** of the hook-sent event. This is generated when a webhook is triggered because its event name matches the name of an event generated by the API or a device.

{{> webhook-tutorial-example options="api,event,hook-sent"}}

The third item is the **Webhook received** (orange) which is the data that was received by the server that was specified in the Webhook URL field. In this case, it's a POST request, and the HTTP headers and body are displayed. These will be described in more detail below, but the body comes from the JSON configured in the Webhook, and the data within the body comes from the published event. Note that individual fields like headers and body also scroll horizontally.

{{> webhook-tutorial-example options="api,hook"}}

The fourth item is **Parsed data** (pink) which is a JSON decoded version of the published event data. The time at the top is your local time, as determine by your browser, not the actual event time.

{{> webhook-tutorial-example options="api,data"}}

The fifth item is **Webhook response** is the data that the webhook server is returning to the Particle webhook system. The body is also JSON in this case, and includes whether this is successful ("ok":true) as well as the "id" that was in the original request. 

{{> webhook-tutorial-example options="api,hookResponse"}}

The sixth item is the **Event (Internal)** containing the hook-response. This is the event that is sent by the Particle webhook service. The name begins with "api" because it would normally begin with the Device ID that published the triggering event, but since the test button was used, there is no Device ID. It's just "api".

{{> webhook-tutorial-example options="api,event,hook-response"}}

### Device firmware

The next step is to run the firmware below on a device. The code will be explained line-by-line below, but for now you don't need to understand everything about it, except:

- It will publish an event every minute that will trigger the webhook.
- If you tap the MODE button once, it will also generate an event.
- Because of this, if you leave this firmware running it will use at least two data operations per minute, one for the request and one for the response.
- You can flash the device right from the box below, but note that it will replace the existing device firmware and you won't be able to restore the original firmware automatically.

{{> codebox content="/assets/files/webhook-tutorial.cpp" format="cpp" height="400" flash="true"}}

The firmware output information from the debugging serial port, so you may want to connect the device by USB to your computer and use the Particle CLI command:

```
particle serial monitor
```

This will show both the published events and the response:

```
0006480001 [app] INFO: publish WebhookTutorial01 {"op":"periodic","id":1652008511,"powerSource":2,"soc":-1}
0006480913 [app] INFO: hook response {"ok":true,"id":1652008511}
```

The log output will be similar to the test but first item will be **Event (Device)**. Note that the **coreid** contains the Device ID that generated the device. This is secure; there is no way to generate an arbitrary ID or spoof an ID in this field. 

{{> webhook-tutorial-example options="device,event,trigger"}}

The **Webhook received** event is similar but note the **coreid** in the body. You will often use this to determine which device sent the webhook. Note that other things, like the device name (which is not necessarily unique), and other identifying things like the serial number, ICCID, etc. are not passed to the webhook so you should use the Device ID (coreid) as the unique identifier for a device.

{{> webhook-tutorial-example options="device,hook"}}

The **Parsed data** is JSON, which is easy to parse and generate, and is easily extendible. On cellular devices it will contain the **powerSource** and battery **soc** (state-of-charge) items, for example.

{{> webhook-tutorial-example options="device,data"}}

The last **Event (Internal)** is the hook-response that is generated.

{{> webhook-tutorial-example options="device,event,hook-response"}}


### Webhook details

The **Event Name** is **{{webhook-tutorial "webhookName"}}**. Note that the event name is a prefix; any event that begins with this string will trigger the webhook. For this reason, you probably don't want to use too short of a string.

The **URL** is the server you are sending data to. This could be your own server, a service like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, or another 3rd-party service that is handling your data. The random-ish data in this URL is just so the data you publish stays separate from other users of this tutorial. Note that every time you reload this page the URL changes for this tutorial.

The **Request Type** is a HTTP method, typically GET, POST, or PUT. The method depends on what your server is expecting.

The **Request Format** depends on the method, and what your server is expecting. For POST and PUT, this is typically JSON or Web Form. This tutorial server only works with JSON formatted data in a POST.

The **Device** can be limited to a single device in your account, or **Any**. Product webhooks don't have this option and are always triggered for every device in the product fleet.

The **Status** can be used to temporarily disable a webhook.

The **Response Topic** is **{{webhook-tutorial "responseTopic"}}**. Breaking this down, there are three components separated by slashes.

- `\{{{PARTICLE_DEVICE_ID}}}` puts the Device ID of the requesting device in the beginning of the response topic. This is desirable because it allows the event to only go to the device that triggered the webhook. Without this, the event could go to every device, which is not only unnecessary, but also will use an unnecessarily large number of data operations.
- `hook-response` is a constant string for the hook response, to differentiate it from errors and hook-sent.
- `\{{{PARTICLE_EVENT_NAME}}}` is the name of the triggering event. This makes it possible for the subscriber to handle responses for multiple webhooks.

The end result will be something like "{{webhook-tutorial "lastDeviceId"}}/hook-response/{{webhook-tutorial "webhookName"}}".

The response topic must match the subscription in your source code. This is what the tutorial source uses:

```cpp
Particle.subscribe(System.deviceID() + "/hook-response/" + String(eventName), hookResponseHandler);
```

The **Error Topic** works just like the response topic, but for errors.

### Webhook errors

There are two ways to return an error from your webhook server:

- Return a HTTP error code (not 200)
- Return a HTTP success code (200) and include the error condition in the response data.

We highly recommend the latter for most cases, except situations where the server is actually overloaded or failing with an internal error that is not caused by the request data. 

The reason is that when a webhook server returns an error, it will always be retried three times. Additionally, if the number of errors becomes large relative to the number of successful requests, the server will be throttled. This shows in the console as "Sleep" and is designed to prevent overloading the server. The success/failure rating is determined by the hostname in the URL, and is not per-account, so you can inadvertently cause other webhooks to sleep by returning errors.

### Firmware details

This is recommended for all applications:

- Enable the serial log handler instead of using `Serial.print`.
- Use `SYSTEM_THREAD(ENABLED)`.

```cpp
#include "Particle.h"

SerialLogHandler logHandler;

SYSTEM_THREAD(ENABLED);
```

The first configurable parameter is the name of the webhook, which must prefix match the webhook configuration.

The second configurable parameter is how often to publish, once per minute in this example.

```cpp
const char *eventName = "WebhookTutorial01";

std::chrono::milliseconds testPublishPeriod = 1min;
```

The setup() function does one-time setup.

The `Particle.subscribe` function sets the event to subscribe to. This must match the **Response Topic** in the webhook configuration. Note all applications need to know whether the webhook succeeded or not. If you don't need this information, leaving off the subscription will reduce in half the number of data operations used per publish by only sending the data one way (device to cloud) instead of both ways.

The button click handler makes the test firmware publish an event when the MODE button is pressed.

```cpp
void setup()
{
    Particle.subscribe(System.deviceID() + "/hook-response/" + String(eventName), hookResponseHandler);

    // Register a click handler for the MODE button
    System.on(button_click, clickHandler);
}
```

The button handler (clickHandler()) runs at interrupt time and you can't publish directly from the handler. It sets a flag variable (`buttonClicked`) and handles it from `loop()` instead.

```cpp
if (buttonClicked)
{
    buttonClicked = false;
    testButton();
}
```

This code handles the periodic publishing of events.

```cpp
if (millis() - lastPublish >= testPublishPeriod.count())
{
    lastPublish = millis();

    testPeriodic();
}
```

The publishes contain a unique integer value `id`. While it's not unreasonable to always start the ID at 0 at reboot, another option is to set it to a random value. The standard C library function `rand()` is pseudo-random but is seeded with a new random value when connecting to the cloud, so that works well.

```cpp
if (hookSequence == 0 && Particle.connected())
{
    // Wait until Particle.connected because the rand() is seeded from the cloud
    hookSequence = rand();
}
```

This is the function to create the periodic publish data.

The publish data is generated in JSON format because it's easy to generate and decode, and is easily extensible in the future. Note that the publish here is limited to 255 bytes (plus a null terminator) but on many devices, the limit is actually 1024 bytes.

```cpp
void testPeriodic()
{
    char buf[256];

    JSONBufferWriter writer(buf, sizeof(buf));
    writer.beginObject();
```

Here we fill in the JSON data in the publish. The `op` is the operation code, either `periodic` or `button`.

The `id` is a monotonically increasing integer and is a useful thing to add to your JSON payload. Because event delivery is best-effort, at least once, it's possible for a single event to be delivered more than once. This can happen if the ACK is lost, causing the device to send it again. Including a unique ID helps in dedupe in your server code.

Also, if you sent multiple events, it is possible that the subscription handlers may be called in a different order than the original request, and the `id` can help with this.

```cpp
    writer.name("op").value("periodic");
    if (hookSequence != 0)
    {
        writer.name("id").value(hookSequence++);
    }
```

This is an example of how easy it is to adjust the JSON payload. On cellular devices it adds two additional pieces of information: the power source and the state-of-charge (SoC) of the battery.

```cpp
#if HAL_PLATFORM_POWER_MANAGEMENT
    writer.name("powerSource").value(System.powerSource());
    writer.name("soc").value(System.batteryCharge());
#endif
```

Finally, this code completes the JSON object and sends it, if the cloud is connected.

You should always check that the cloud is connected before publishing.

```cpp
    writer.endObject();
    writer.buffer()[std::min(writer.bufferSize(), writer.dataSize())] = 0;

    if (Particle.connected())
    {
        Particle.publish(eventName, buf);
        Log.info("publish %s %s", eventName, buf);
    }
    else
    {
        Log.info("periodic but not cloud connected %s", buf);
    }
}
```

This does the publish for pressing the button. It's pretty much a simpler subset of the code from the periodic case.

```cpp
void testButton()
{
    char buf[256];

    JSONBufferWriter writer(buf, sizeof(buf));
    writer.beginObject();
    writer.name("op").value("button");
    if (hookSequence != 0)
    {
        writer.name("id").value(hookSequence++);
    }
    writer.endObject();
    writer.buffer()[std::min(writer.bufferSize(), writer.dataSize())] = 0;

    if (Particle.connected())
    {
        Particle.publish(eventName, buf);
        Log.info("publish %s %s", eventName, buf);
    }
    else
    {
        Log.info("button pressed but not cloud connected %s", buf);
    }
}
```

We don't really do anything with the subscription, but a log message is printed and can be seen if you are using `particle serial monitor` or other serial terminal program.

Note that you should never publish and event from a subscription handler as they share an internal buffer and the data may become corrupted.

```cpp
void hookResponseHandler(const char *event, const char *data)
{
    Log.info("hook response %s", data);
}
```

As mentioned above, the `button_click` may be run at interrupt time, and you should not do the actual publish from the handler. Instead, update a variable and handle the operation from `loop()`.

```cpp
// MODE button click handler
void clickHandler(system_event_t event, int param)
{
    // int times = system_button_clicks(param);

    // This can be called from an interrupt context so you can only use the small
    // number of interrupt-safe functions here
    buttonClicked = true;
}
```

### Clean-up

To clean up after this tutorial, you might want to delete the webhook that was created.

If you flashed the test project firmware to a device, you may want to flash Tinker so the device will stop publishing periodically. You can also flash your own firmware instead.
